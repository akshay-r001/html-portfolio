<p><strong>Vineeth Srinivasan </strong> movie - young, campus based, music based. Quite in line with "Thattathin marayathe pennu". To draw a comparison, Pranav has a whole lot more flair to offer than Nivin.

    Music has been well done, and is a continuous presence. Blending music into the situations has been pretty seamless.
    
    Cinematography has been good. The interval shot with Pranav at a train door against red light is a keeper.
    
    There is a lot of college nostalgia through out the movie. Some of the moments in the movie feel very genuine.
    
    The movie did not end with a bang for me. Nothing substantial really came out. However, there is a lot of heart and youthful enthusiasm through the movie. Darshana and Pranav have performed very well, and Pranav is slowly firming his foot as the romantic star.</p>

    <h2>Minnal Murali</h2>
    <img src="./photo/minnal murali.png" alt="poster of minnal murali movie">

    <p><strong>Basil Joseph’s </strong> fantasy fiction drama Minnal Murali. Yet another friendly, neighborhood superhero is born in the ‘movieverse’ through the film, only a bit goofier and more genial.

        Jaison (Tovino Thomas) is just another boy-next-door with big dreams. One night, during which lightning randomly strikes him, changes things for the youngster. He acquires a spectrum of powers, and explores them with the help of his nephew Josemon. How he tackles the opposing forces around, a nemesis as powerful as him and more forms the crux of the fantasy drama.
        
        Complete with the red spandex, the lightning bolt on the chest, a pure heart and more, Tovino bolsters his part well, with undeniable charm. Both as a playful, childlike adult and a newbie superhero, he brings out the naïve sense of wonder within us while reading or watching fantasy thrillers. Basil Joseph too deserves points for shaping the superhero thus. The scenes in which he discovers his powers with Josemon are fun to watch, especially his silly heroic stunts in the beginning. The character of the aberrant antagonist, played by Guru Somasundaram, is quite memorable that you can’t help feeling for the man who turns villain due to his experiences and circumstances. His transformation, how he handles the malign attention he receives and more are presented well by the actor. The film’s songs are also both groovy and melodious and placed well in the storyline.
        
        The ‘supe’ origin part of the film does take some time to get into the groove. Also, one can’t help noticing a handful of scenes that are on the verge of melodrama packed with some heavy dialogues. The template ingredients, like the absence of parents, underdog qualities, ‘the meant for greatness discovery’ and the like are lined up, but not too distastefully. The fight choreography isn’t arresting enough for a film of the genre, though the team has compensated the same through visual effects, emotional depth and character development.
        
        The film is a modest, jocular entertainer with both a likeable superhero and villain.

<h2>Romancham</h2>
<img src="./photo/Romancham-poster.png" alt="poster of Romancham movie">
<p> A group of youngsters living in Bengaluru use the Ouija board and things go hilariously wrong</p>
<p>A horror movie but a laugh riot? Bingo, Romancham is the movie that gives us this wonderful formula. There is no exaggeration, no nonsensical humour, the movie is simply hilarious and interestingly, it's inspired from real life incidents. That's where the brilliance of the writer-director<strong> Jithu Madhavan </strong>comes in. This is an epic take of a story that could have gone wrong if handled carelessly.
    The entire theatre was roaring with laughter the whole time and cheering along with the awesome characters. And the wonderful music by Sushin Shyam, it's use in the right time and place makes the movie even better. Adaranjali Neratte (Rest in Peace) is a line that no one would expect to want to sing again and again but after Romancham, you will find yourself repeating those lines.
    The film focuses on a group of youngsters living in Bengaluru who plays Ouija board. Things go wrong for them and gets funny for us when the ghost they summon through Ouija board decides to stay back. Without a ghost or any usual 'ghost' elements, the director manages to create a situation that is scary, at least for the characters.
    Arjun Asokan did a good job as Sinu whose antics take the group of youngsters to the edge. Soubin Shahir as Jibi was good. There is a situation where he and Abin Bino's Shijappan appear to be conspiring which is beautifully done. Afzal PH as Karikuttan and Sajin Gopu and Niroop are unforgettable characters who made everything even more hilarious. Siju Sunny, Anantharaman Ajay, Jagadheesh Kumar and Joemon Jyothir all did their parts well. In his Cameo, Chemban Vinod gifts us a memorable scene that leads to a bout of inappropriate laughter.
